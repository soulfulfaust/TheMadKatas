# Record architecture decisions

Date: 2021-04-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The architectural decisions made on this project must be recorded in a useful and comprehensible manner.

## Decision

Architecture Decision Records, [as described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), will be used to record our architecture decisions.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Easy to access decisions.
- Easy to find out why a decision was made.
- Quick to learn how to create and use ADRs.

**Negative:**

- Need to on-board everyone on the project to understand ADRs.

**Risks:**

- Someone not familiar with ADRs may not know where to find them or that they exist.

**Bonus Features:**

- This format will be something we use in other projects to improve architecture decisions governance!
